# uob-beamer

This is a LaTeX beamer theme for the University of Bristol.

This is a modification of [nschloe/ua-beamer](https://www.github.com/nschloe/ua-beamer).

It is currently mainly for use for the BRIDGE research group of the School of
Geographical Sciences but will be extended to be more generic with options for
a School theme as well as a Univeristy theme.

The theme only support the standard 4:3 aspect ratio but I plan to support wide
screen 16:10 and 16:9 in the near future.
